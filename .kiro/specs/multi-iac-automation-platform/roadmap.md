# Platform Roadmap — Implementation Slices

This document captures the incremental delivery plan for the multi-IaC automation platform (turnip). Each slice is a self-contained, implementable unit with its own spec (requirements, design, tasks).

The global spec in this directory (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) serves as the north-star vision. Individual slice specs live in their own directories under `.kiro/specs/`.

## Slice Details

### Slice 0: Project Scaffolding

**Goal**: Establish the Go project skeleton so all subsequent slices have a foundation to build on.

**Delivers**:
- Go module with dependency management
- Directory structure (`cmd/server`, `cmd/runner`, `internal/...`)
- Dockerfiles for server and runner images
- Protobuf setup and code generation
- Makefile / task runner
- Basic CI pipeline
- Linting and formatting configuration

**No business logic** — purely structural.

---

### Slice 1: Config Parsing & Project Matching

**Goal**: Parse `turnip.yaml` and determine which projects should trigger based on file changes.

**Delivers**:
- YAML schema definition and parser
- Project configuration validation
- Glob pattern matching for `whenModified` rules
- Property tests for round-trip parsing and pattern matching

**Global requirements covered**: 1, 2, 18

---

### Slice 2: Plugin System & Helmfile Plugin

**Goal**: Define the unified Plugin interface and implement Helmfile as the first plugin.

**Delivers**:
- Plugin interface (`GetOperations`, `Execute`, `Name`, `GetPlanOperation`, `GetApplyOperation`)
- `ExecuteOptions`, `ExecuteResult`, `ChangeSummary` types
- Helmfile plugin: diff, apply, sync, destroy operations
- Output parsing for changed releases
- Environment configuration support
- Property tests for plugin correctness

**Global requirements covered**: 3, 13

---

### Slice 3: Redis Lock Manager

**Goal**: Implement Redis-based locking to prevent concurrent operations and store plan data.

**Delivers**:
- `LockManager` interface implementation
- Lock acquisition with `SET NX` (no TTL)
- Plan data storage and retrieval
- Lock release on apply/merge/close/manual unlock
- Lock status querying
- Property tests for lock safety

**Global requirements covered**: 7, 20

---

### Slice 4: GitHub Client & Webhook Handler

**Goal**: Handle GitHub App auth, receive webhooks, parse comments, manage check runs and PR comments.

**Delivers**:
- GitHub App authentication (private key, installation tokens)
- Webhook HTTP handler with signature verification
- Comment parser (trigger patterns, project names, extra args)
- Check run creation/updates
- PR comment posting/updating (consolidated, collapsible)
- Collaborator authorization checks
- Property tests for parsing and authorization

**Global requirements covered**: 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17

---

### Slice 5: gRPC & Runner

**Goal**: Establish communication between Server and Runner, implement runner lifecycle.

**Delivers**:
- Protobuf service definition (`OperationService`)
- gRPC server implementation (in Server process)
- gRPC client implementation (in Runner process)
- Runner startup: env parsing, repo cloning, plugin execution
- Log streaming from Runner to Server
- Kubernetes Job creation and cleanup
- Per-tool initContainer provisioning (vendor-official images, version selected from `config.version`)
- Property tests for runner behavior

**Global requirements covered**: 8, 14

---

### Slice 6: Server Orchestration

**Goal**: Wire all components together into the complete webhook-to-operation flow.

**Delivers**:
- PR event handler (opened, synchronized, closed, merged)
- Comment event handler (trigger detection, authorization, execution)
- Operation orchestration (parallel execution, result collection)
- Lock acquisition → runner creation → result → comment/check flow
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

**Global requirements covered**: 4, 5, 6, 17, 19, 20

---

### Slice 7: Terraform & Pulumi Plugins

**Goal**: Add remaining IaC tool support.

**Delivers**:
- Terraform plugin: plan, apply, -destroy flag, output parsing, workspace support
- Pulumi plugin: preview, up, destroy, output parsing, stack support
- Property tests for each plugin

**Global requirements covered**: 11, 12

---

### Slices 8-11: Production Readiness (formerly one "HA, Observability & Deployment" slice)

What was originally scoped as a single Slice 8 turned out to be too
broad for one implementable unit and was split into four, sequenced by
actual dependency rather than the original bullet order. Each has its
own spec directory (`requirements.md`/`design.md`); Slice 7 (Terraform &
Pulumi Plugins) is independent of all four and can be picked up in any
order relative to them.

### Slice 8: Structured Logging

**Goal**: Replace unstructured `log.Printf`/`fmt.Fprintf` calls with
`log/slog`-based structured, leveled logging.

**Delivers**:
- `internal/logging` package (`TURNIP_LOG_LEVEL` parsing, `log/slog` setup)
- Every existing Server/Runner log call site rewritten to structured logging

**Global requirements covered**: non-functional

---

### Slice 9: Metrics & Health Endpoints

**Goal**: Give the Server an HTTP observability surface.

**Delivers**:
- `/healthz`/`/readyz` endpoints (and the `http.ServeMux` routing change
  they require in `cmd/server/main.go`)
- Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`) — webhook, Operation, lock, and Runner
  Job Start Latency signals
- A Grafana dashboard (JSON) for those metrics

**Global requirements covered**: non-functional

---

### Slice 10: Deployment — Kustomize & Release Images

**Goal**: Make turnip actually deployable, with real versioned images.

**Delivers**:
- Kustomize base (Deployment, Service, RBAC) + an example `kind` overlay
  + an opt-in Grafana-dashboard-provisioning component
- Versioned release images: replace the Server/Runner images' `:latest`
  tag (a stand-in since Slice 0) with a real release version, via
  `goreleaser` — the Runner image is now a required
  `TURNIP_RUNNER_IMAGE` config value (`internal/jobs.OperationParams.RunnerImage`),
  not a package constant

**Global requirements covered**: non-functional

---

### Slice 11: HA Validation & Documentation

**Goal**: Prove the stateless/multi-instance HA design holds under real
concurrency and a real deployment; document the finished platform.

**Delivers**:
- Stateless server validation (no in-memory state) — real-Redis,
  multi-instance integration tests, part of default CI
- Multi-instance testing under concurrent load, including a `kind`-cluster
  variant deployed via Slice 10's overlay (run on demand, not default CI)
- Documentation (README, deployment guide, troubleshooting)

**Global requirements covered**: 19

---

### Slice 12: Runner Workspace & Project Environment

**Goal**: Give the Runner a fixed, documented filesystem layout, and let a
Project declare environment variables for its Operation — so that
configuration a repository already commits can be referenced by tools
that have no configuration hook of their own.

**Delivers**:
- A single `/turnip` namespace: Workspace at `/turnip/src`, Tools
  directory at `/turnip/tools`, as two separate `emptyDir` volumes so the
  tool-provisioning initContainer cannot reach the Workspace
- The Workspace path passed to the Runner by environment variable
  (mirroring `TURNIP_TOOLS_DIR`), with a temporary-directory fallback so
  unit tests and local runs are unaffected
- An `env` map on a Project in `turnip.yaml`, applied to the IaC_Tool
  subprocess, with `TURNIP_`-prefixed names and `PATH` rejected at parse
  time
- An enforced, unambiguous schema version: `schemaVersion: v1alpha1`
  replacing the current `version: 1`, which is parsed but never validated
  and reads as a product version turnip doesn't have. Alpha states that
  the schema will keep breaking pre-1.0; it graduates to `v1` when turnip
  reaches 1.0, at which point schema and project major coincide
- Documentation of all three in `docs/configuration.md`

**Not in this slice**: provisioning additional binaries (helm plugins,
cloud CLIs), remote-cluster authentication, and Azure Workload Identity
pod labels — the last is in the Backlog below.

**Global requirements covered**: none directly. Extends the shared-volume
mechanism of global Requirement 14.2a; adjacent to Requirement 18 without
changing its `config` map.

---

## Backlog (not yet sliced)

Recorded so they aren't rediscovered the hard way. Neither has a spec
directory, and neither is scheduled.

### Azure Workload Identity needs Runner *pod* labels

turnip selects the Runner pod's ServiceAccount
(`TURNIP_RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, optionally overridden per Project), and
for AWS EKS Pod Identity and GCP Workload Identity that is the whole job:
both attach the identity association to the ServiceAccount object itself,
which an operator creates and turnip only references by name. GCP even
allows the target service account to live in another project, so no
second step is needed there.

Azure differs in one respect: its mutating admission webhook injects
nothing at all unless the **pod** carries the label
`azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`. Identity selection itself stays on
the ServiceAccount (the `azure.workload.identity/client-id` annotation,
which explicitly supports one ServiceAccount referencing many
identities), so that part needs nothing from turnip.

The gap is that `internal/jobs.BuildJob` sets labels on the *Job's*
ObjectMeta and gives the pod template no ObjectMeta at all — so turnip
sets no pod labels or annotations whatsoever today.

Likely shape: an operator-controlled passthrough (Server configuration,
not `turnip.yaml`, since nothing here should be PR-editable) applying
labels and annotations to the pod template. JSON-encoded rather than
comma-separated: label values can't contain commas, but annotation values
are arbitrary strings and can — Azure's own
`azure.workload.identity/skip-containers` is semicolon-separated. A
reserved prefix should stop an operator silently overwriting the keys
turnip uses for correlation.

### Expose the workspace path as a variable rather than a literal

Slice 12 fixes the Runner's workspace at `/turnip/src`, which repositories
may reference from committed configuration. That is fine while turnip has
no releases and one consumer, and relocating the path is a release-gated
change.

It stops being fine with several consumers: a version bump reaches the
operator who changes the image tag, but the breakage lands in other
teams' repositories, which didn't choose the upgrade. The established fix
is to make a variable the interface rather than the literal path —
GitHub documents `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, GitLab documents `CI_PROJECT_DIR`,
both precisely so the path underneath can move.

The obstacle is that turnip launches the tool without a shell, so a value
like `${TURNIP_WORKSPACE_DIR}/...` arrives literally; supporting it means
expanding a placeholder when applying a Project's `env`. Small, but only
worth building when a second repository onboards or the path needs to
move. Woodpecker shows the cost of leaving it too long: having made the
workspace configurable after plugins had already hardcoded it, it now
carries a permanent exception — "Plugins will always have the workspace
base at `/woodpecker`".

## Notes

- Slices 1–5 can be developed in parallel once Slice 0 is complete
- Each slice should be merged to `main` before starting dependent slices
- The global spec remains the source of truth for cross-cutting concerns
- Individual slice specs may refine or add detail beyond the global spec
